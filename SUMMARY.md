## SynGen AI Codebase: Simple, Step-by-Step Explanation

### What is SynGen AI?

Imagine you can talk to a computer and ask questions about a big table of supply chain data, just like you talk to a person. SynGen AI is a special computer program that listens to your questions (in plain English), turns them into smart computer questions (called SQL), checks if those questions are safe and make sense, gets the answers from the data, and then explains the answers to you in simple words.

### How is SynGen AI Built? (Like a Team of Helpers)

SynGen AI is like a team of little helpers (called "agents"). Each helper has a special job:

- **Intent Router**: This helper listens to your question and decides what you want (for example, do you want to see some data, or do you want an explanation?).
- **SQL Generator**: This helper takes your question and writes a computer question (SQL) that the database can understand.
- **SQL Validator**: This helper checks the computer question to make sure it is safe and correct.
- **SQL Critic**: This helper looks at the computer question and suggests ways to make it even better.
- **Result Explainer**: This helper takes the answer from the database and explains it to you in simple words.

All these helpers work together, like a relay race, to answer your question!

### What are the Main Parts (Folders and Files)?

- **Backend/**: This is the main house where all the helpers live.
  - **app.py**: The front door! This is where questions come in and answers go out.
  - **application/models.py**: This is like a set of rules for what questions and answers should look like.
  - **core/db.py**: This is the phone that talks to the big table of data (the database).
  - **core/logging.py**: This is a notebook where the helpers write down what happens, so you can check later if something went wrong.
  - **core/security.py**: This is the lock on the door, making sure only the right people can ask questions.
  - **feature/**: This is where the helpers do their special jobs.
    - **feature.md**: A storybook that explains what each helper does.
    - **intent_router.py**: The Intent Router helper lives here.
    - **prompt_builder.py**: This is a helper that helps the other helpers ask good questions to the computer.
    - **promt_templates.py**: This is a box of question examples for the helpers to use.
    - **rag.py**: This helper finds extra information from documents to help answer tricky questions.
    - **txt_to_sql.py**: This is the boss helper that tells all the other helpers what to do, step by step.
    - **agents/**: This is a room where all the special helpers live (Intent Router, SQL Generator, SQL Validator, SQL Critic, Result Explainer).
  - **templates/sql_templates.py**: This is a recipe book for making computer questions (SQL).
  - **tests/test_txt_to_sql.py**: This is a playground where the helpers practice to make sure they work well.

- **Document_Repository(dataco-global-policy-dataset)/**: This is a library of documents the helpers can read if they need more information.
- **Supply_chain_database(dataco-supply-chain-dataset)/**: This is the big table of data (the database) where the answers come from.
- **file_st.py**: This is a toolbox with extra tools for the helpers.
- **doit.md**: This is a to-do list for the people building SynGen AI.
- **README.md**: This is a welcome letter that explains what SynGen AI is.
- **requirements.txt**: This is a shopping list of things SynGen AI needs to work.
- **example.env**: This is a cheat sheet for secret codes and settings.
- **TODO.txt**: This is another list of things to fix or make better.
- **SUMMARY.md**: (This file!) This is the big map that explains everything.

### How Does a Question Get Answered? (Step by Step)

1. **You ask a question** (like "How many products were shipped last month?").
2. The **Intent Router** helper listens and decides what you want.
3. The **SQL Generator** helper writes a computer question (SQL) for the database.
4. The **SQL Validator** helper checks if the question is safe and makes sense.
5. The **SQL Critic** helper suggests ways to make the question even better.
6. The question is sent to the **database** (the big table of data).
7. The **Result Explainer** helper takes the answer and explains it to you in simple words.

### What Can Be Improved? (Open Ends)

- Make the helpers even better at catching mistakes and explaining what went wrong.
- Make the lock on the door (security) even stronger.
- Add new helpers, like one that draws pictures (charts) of the data.
- Make the question examples (prompts) even smarter.
- Help the helpers find information in the library (documents) even faster.
- Add more practice games (tests) for the helpers.
- Put all the secret codes and settings in one easy-to-find place.
- Write more stories and guides to help new people join the team.
- Make the helpers run even faster.
- Maybe build a fun, easy-to-use website for people to ask questions.

### In Short

SynGen AI is like a team of friendly helpers that work together to answer your questions about supply chain data. Each helper has a special job, and together they make sure you get the answer you need, in a way that's easy to understand. If you want to help make SynGen AI better, you can read the welcome letter (`README.md`), this map (`SUMMARY.md`), and visit the helpers in the `feature/agents/` room to see how they work!
