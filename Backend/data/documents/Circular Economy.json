This policy sets forth quantifiable rules, responsibilities, and targets to ensure\neffective implementation and continuous improvement.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all Dataco Global offices, data and information management services, and\nsupply chain activities worldwide[2][4].\n1. Circular Economy Integration\nAll procurement contracts must prioritize vendors who supply reusable, recyclable, or\nremanufactured products, with at least 50% of all purchased office and IT equipment\nmeeting these criteria by FY2026.\nDataco Global will develop and implement data lifecycle management systems that maximize\ndata reuse and minimize redundancy, targeting a 20% reduction in duplicate digital storage\nby FY2026.\nService offerings to clients must include recommendations for digital resource optimization\nand data process streamlining to minimize environmental impact.\n2. Waste Reduction Targets\nAchieve a minimum 60% reduction in general office waste by weight compared to FY2024\nbaseline levels by end of FY2026.\nDivert at least 75% of electronic waste from landfill annually by engaging certified e-waste\nrecycling partners for all obsolete IT hardware.\nReduce single-use plastics in all global offices by 90% by piece count by FY2026,\nsubstituting with reusable or compostable alternatives.\n3. Data and Document Management\nImplement mandatory digital documentation for all internal and client communications by\nFY2025, reducing paper use by at least 85% compared to FY2024.\nShred and recycle 100% of sensitive paper documents in compliance with data privacy\nregulations and recycling protocols[5].\n4. Employee Engagement and Accountability\nAll employees must complete annual training in circular economy principles and waste\nmanagement best practices, with 100% participation tracked each calendar year.\nEach department head is responsible for quarterly reporting on waste reduction and circularity\nKPIs, including progress towards targets specified in this policy.\n5. Supplier and Partner Requirements\nNew contracts with vendors and partners must include specific clauses mandating compliance\nwith Dataco Global\u02bcs circularity and waste reduction criteria, verified through annual audits.\nPreferential consideration in procurement is to be given to suppliers who demonstrate\nquantifiable circular practices, such as returning packaging material for reuse or offering take-\nback programs for end-of-life equipment.\n6. Monitoring, Auditing, and Continuous Improvement\nAn annual sustainability audit will measure corporate waste generation, recycling rates, and\nprogress towards stated goals, with results published in Dataco Global\u02bcs sustainability report.\nPolicy targets and processes will be reviewed every 12 months, with updates enacted to\naddress new technologies, regulatory requirements, or operational insights.\nNote:\nThis policy has been generated specially for the hackathon.
