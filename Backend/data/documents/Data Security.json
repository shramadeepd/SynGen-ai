  "content": "Dataco Global Data Security and Cybersecurity Policy\nPurpose\nThis policy defines the mandatory rules and procedures for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability of Dataco Global's data, technology infrastructure, and related information assets.\nThe goal is to minimize risks from human error, system malfunction, and malicious cyber activity by\nimplementing best-practice controls and quantifiable standards[2][5].\nScope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, third-party vendors, interns, and visitors with\ntemporary or permanent access to Dataco Global\u02bcs systems, networks, or physical premises[5].\n1. Access Management and Controls\nAll user accounts must employ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and strong password\nprotection: passwords must be at least 12 characters, include upper and lower case letters,\nnumbers, and symbols[1].\nUser access must follow the principle of least privilege. Employees are granted access only to\nthe information necessary for their job role. Quarterly reviews will audit access levels for 100%\nof users to ensure compliance[1].\nUser session timeouts must be enforced after 15 minutes of inactivity, with automatic log-off\nto prevent unauthorized access[1].\nAll failed login attempts above five within a 24-hour period will result in account lockout for a\nminimum of 30 minutes and trigger an automated security alert.\n2. Data Classification and Protection\nAll company data must be classified into: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted.\nConfidential or Restricted data must be encrypted both in transit (using a minimum of TLS 1.3)\nand at rest (using AES-256 encryption as standard)[2].\nNo more than 5% of company data can be stored unencrypted at any given time; regular scans\nwill verify compliance every month.\nPhysical access to servers and data centers is restricted to authorized personnel only and\nrequires badge access, with logs retained for at least 12 months.\n3. Network Security\nFirewalls must be deployed at all external network boundaries, with port scanning and intrusion\ndetection systems (IDS) monitoring traffic 24/7[2].\nAll software and firmware must be updated and patched within 7 business days of release for\ncritical vulnerabilities.\nRemote access to company systems must use VPN with 256-bit encryption, and connections\nfrom untrusted networks are automatically blocked.\n4. Incident Response\nAll employees must report suspected security incidents within 15 minutes of discovery to the\nIT Security Team via a dedicated channel[1].\nIncident response procedures must be tested twice a year through tabletop or live simulation\nexercises.\nThe IT Security Team must begin containment and assessment of high-severity incidents\nwithin 1 hour of detection, and external breaches must be disclosed to leadership within 24\nhours[1].\n5. Training and Awareness\nAll employees and contractors must complete cybersecurity awareness training within 30 days\nof hire and participate in annual refresher courses; compliance rate must exceed 98%\ncompany-wide.\nA minimum of 5 simulated phishing exercises will be conducted per year; any employee failing\nmore than two will receive additional training.\n6. Data Retention and Disposal\nCompany data classified as Confidential or Restricted must be retained for no longer than 7\nyears unless legally required.\nSecure data destruction methods (e.g., shredding, wiping with DoD 5220.22-M standard) are\nrequired for all data and devices being decommissioned, with 100% compliance documented.\n7. Audit and Compliance\nQuarterly internal audits will verify adherence to this policy, with results reported to executive\nmanagement. Any critical non-compliances must be remediated within 14 business days.\nExternal audits for compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) will be\nconducted at least annually.\nNote:\nThis policy has been generated specially for hackathon purposes. It has no relation with Syngenta\nor any other company.",
