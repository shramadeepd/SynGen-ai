Introduction\nThis Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) Policy outlines the expectations, standards, and\nprocedures governing Dataco Global\u02bcs engagement with suppliers. The purpose is to ensure\ntransparency, compliance, ethical practices, and the achievement of strategic objectives. This\npolicy applies to all Dataco Global employees, suppliers, and service providers engaged in\nprocurement, supply chain, and related activities[1][3].\n2. Objectives\nEstablish clear and quantifiable criteria for sourcing, contracting, and managing supplier\nrelationships.\nEnsure legal, ethical, and sustainable practices across the supply chain.\nPromote risk management, continuous improvement, and value creation for all parties[1][2].\n3.

Supplier Selection and Evaluation\nSuppliers must have a minimum of three years of operating history and provide references\nupon request.\nOnly suppliers that achieve a minimum compliance score of 85% in our Supplier Audit\nChecklist will be considered for partnership.\nDataco Global requires at least three competitive bids for all purchases exceeding USD 50,000.\nRe-evaluation of each active supplier must occur at least once every 12 months, with results\ndocumented and shared with relevant stakeholders[1][2][3].\n5. Compliance and Conduct\nAll suppliers must comply with applicable labor, tax, and social security laws, as well as\nenvironmental and data protection regulations.\nA zero-tolerance approach applies to bribery, corruption, and violation of human rights within\nthe supply chain.\nSuppliers are required to sign Dataco Global\u02bcs Code of Conduct, which includes commitments\nto non-discrimination, diversity, and inclusion[1].\n6. Performance Management\nSupplier performance will be measured quarterly using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nsuch as:\nOn-time delivery rate (target: 98% or higher)\nQuality acceptance rate (target: 95% or higher)\nCustomer complaint rate (maximum: 2% of deliveries per quarter)\nSuppliers failing to meet KPI benchmarks for two consecutive periods will be placed on\nperformance review and may be suspended from future sourcing unless corrective action is\ncompleted within 60 days[2][3].\n7. Communication and Escalation\nAll critical supplier communications (e.g., contract updates, performance reviews, corrective\nactions) must be documented using Dataco Global\u02bcs Supplier Management System.\nIssues requiring escalation (such as legal violations or contract breaches) must be reported to\nthe Procurement Director within 48 hours and resolved within 30 days, where possible[4].\n8. Risk Management\nSuppliers are classified according to risk level (high, medium, low) based on annual risk\nassessments.\nHigh-risk suppliers must provide evidence of annual third-party audits and a business\ncontinuity plan.\nAny supplier engaged in an incident affecting supply continuity, compliance, or reputation\nmust undergo a root-cause analysis and submit a mitigation plan within 15 business days[1].\n9. Termination and Remediation\nDataco Global reserves the right to terminate a supplier relationship for persistent non-\ncompliance, breaches of this policy, or failure to meet corrective action timelines.\nUpon termination, the supplier will be notified in writing and given a minimum notice period of\n30 days unless a severe violation necessitates immediate action[3].\n10. Continuous Improvement\nBiannual supplier forums will be held to foster collaboration, share best practices, and\nintroduce process improvements.\nA minimum of 10% of suppliers will be subject to spot audits each year to ensure ongoing\ncompliance and improvement.\nNote: This policy has been generated specially for a hackathon. It has no relation with\nSyngenta or any other company.",
