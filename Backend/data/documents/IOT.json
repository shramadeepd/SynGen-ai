  "content": "Dataco Global Technology Adoption Policy\nPurpose\nThis policy establishes clear standards for the adoption and management of emerging technologies\n(including Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and related innovations) within Dataco Global. It\nensures all technology use aligns with company objectives, emphasizes security, safeguards data,\nand supports operational excellence through measurable controls and responsibilities.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all employees, contractors, partners, and third-party service providers\ninvolved in the selection, deployment, management, and operation of IoT, Blockchain, and similar\ntechnologies within Dataco Global\u02bcs business processes.\n1. Technology Evaluation and Approval\nAll new technology projects must undergo a standardized evaluation, including risk\nassessment and Return on Investment (ROI) analysis, before approval.\nA minimum of two formal pilot tests, each covering at least 10% of the relevant operational\nenvironment, are required prior to full-scale deployment.\nThe Technology Steering Committee (TSC) must approve any expenditure over $100,000 or\nany project impacting more than 25% of company data infrastructure.\n2. Data Governance and Protection\nData collected or generated by IoT devices and Blockchain applications must be classified\naccording to Dataco Global\u02bcs data governance standards (confidential, internal, public).\nOnly authorized personnel (not exceeding 20% of departmental staff per project) may access\nsensitive or confidential data[4].\nEncryption must be applied to all data transmissions involving IoT devices and Blockchain\ntransactions.\nAll data must be retained only as long as necessary for business or regulatory requirements,\nwith quarterly reviews to ensure compliance[5].\nAt least one Data Steward must be assigned to each project to oversee data ownership, access\ncontrols, and compliance[4].\n3. Security and Compliance\nAll devices and systems must undergo penetration testing at least twice annually.\nAny technology solution must comply with applicable industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001) and\nregulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\nIncident response protocols must be in place, with a maximum incident response time of 4\nhours for critical breaches.\nMulti-factor authentication is mandatory for administrative access to IoT, Blockchain, and\nassociated management platforms.\n4. Performance and Reliability\nIoT systems must achieve at least 99.5% uptime; Blockchain nodes must have a minimum of\ntwo redundant nodes per key business network.\nAll deployed technologies must be reviewed bi-annually for performance, with a target of less\nthan 1% device or node failure rate.\n5. Vendor and Third-Party Management\nAll vendors providing IoT or Blockchain services must sign a data protection agreement and\nundergo an annual security audit.\nNo more than 30% of critical infrastructure may depend on a single third-party provider to\nmitigate operational risks.\n6. Training and Awareness\nAll users must complete an approved training module on responsible technology use and\nsecurity before gaining access to relevant platforms. A refresher course is required every 12\nmonths.\nAt least 95% of identified stakeholders must complete their training within 60 days of\ntechnology rollout.\n7. Monitoring and Reporting\nContinuous monitoring solutions must be deployed for all IoT and Blockchain systems to detect\nanomalies or unauthorized access, with alerting thresholds set according to impact risk.\nQuarterly reports on usage, incidents, and compliance must be submitted to senior\nmanagement.\nNote: This policy has been generated specially for the hackathon. It has no relation with\nSyngenta or any other company.",
