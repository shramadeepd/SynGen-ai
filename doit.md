Edit
-- Example hybrid query
with vec as (
  select id, 1/(rank+1) as score from embedding_tbl
  order by embedding <=> :embed limit 50
),

) s group by id order by total desc limit 10;
9 · Memory strategy
Layer	Backend	TTL
Short-term chat	in-process list	per-request
Rolling window	Redis (LRU)	30 min
Long-term user facts	Redis vector hash	30 days

System Overview
The system consists of a FastAPI server hosting an Agno-based agent, connected to both structured and
unstructured data sources. Incoming user queries hit FastAPI endpoints, which pass them to an Agno Agent
configured with a Gemini (Google) LLM model and various tools. For structured lookups, the agent uses a
SQLTools connection to PostgreSQL (with pgvector ) . For unstructured knowledge, the agent uses
a Chroma vector store to index documents. Redis is used for background tasks, caching, and long-term
memory. Access control is enforced via JWTs containing user roles and region claims . This architecture
aligns with Agno’s reference FastAPI/Postgres setup (FastAPI handling requests; Postgres for sessions,
knowledge, and memories) .
Features
Agentic AI Core: Uses Agno’s high-performance agent framework (model-agnostic, reasoning-first).
Agno claims agents “instantiate in ~3μs and use ~5Kib memory” . Agents can embed domain
knowledge and run reasoning chains.
Natural Language Interface: Supports conversational NL queries via a Gemini LLM. Agents can
leverage pre-built FastAPI routes and can produce fully-typed structured outputs (JSON, SQL,
etc.) .
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integrated support for retrieval. Agno’s vector search is
“state-of-the-art” with hybrid search and re-ranking . The agent can fetch relevant docs from
Chroma (vector DB) or even perform keyword/semantic search in Postgres (via pgvector).
Memory and State: Built-in session and long-term memory drivers . Short-term dialogue context
is stored (in-memory or Redis), while Redis or Postgres can hold long-term agent memory. Tools like
Agno’s PostgresAgentStorage allow persisting history .
FastAPI Integration: Agno provides ready-made FastAPI routes for agents and workflows ,
allowing seamless API exposure.
Lightning-Fast: Optimized for speed – agents and tools run asynchronously with minimal overhead.
Role/Geo Access: JWT-based RBAC and geo-fencing can be enforced at the endpoint level. For
example, a FastAPI dependency can decode a JWT and check payload["role"] and
payload["region"] against allowed values .
Text-to-SQL Pipeline
To handle structured data queries, the agent uses a Text-to-SQL workflow. The LLM (Gemini) is prompted to
generate a SQL query based on the user’s natural language. The system then executes this query in
PostgreSQL. For reliability, follow a robust loop: if execution fails (e.g. syntax or type error), capture the
error message and have the LLM reason about and fix the SQL. Arslan Shahid recommends a three-part
approach: (1) SQL-Agent generates initial query, (2) Error-Reasoning-Agent diagnoses failures, (3) Error-FixAgent corrects the query . In practice, you prompt the model with the schema and error context to retry
until success. Aim for >95% first-pass accuracy in SQL generation . Always use parameterized queries or

ORM tools to avoid injection (as Real Python notes, “prevent Python SQL injection using query
parameters” ). Additionally, preprocess the prompt with database schema and include tools in Agno (e.g.
an agno.tools.sql.SQLTools instance pointing at your DB) so the agent can execute SQL directly .
Example workflow:
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.sql import SQLTools
sql_tool = SQLTools(db_url="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb")
agent = Agent(
model=Gemini(id="your-gemini-model"),
tools=[sql_tool],
instructions=["Use only SELECT queries on allowed tables."],
)
After generation and execution, present results or errors back to the LLM for iterative refinement. This
closed-loop helps catch mistakes, matching the “robust text-to-SQL” pattern described in industry guides
.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline
For unstructured data, the agent implements a RAG pipeline. Documents (e.g. knowledge base articles,
PDFs) are preprocessed and indexed in Chroma (a vector database). At query time, the agent embeds the
user question (using the LLM’s encoder or a shared embedding model) and performs a similarity search in
Chroma. Relevant document chunks are retrieved and fed, along with the query, into the LLM. For example,
Haystack shows how to build a Chroma-backed RAG: after pushing docs into a ChromaDocumentStore ,
you use a ChromaRetriever to fetch context, then generate answers . In code, one might initialize a
retriever like:
from haystack.document_stores import ChromaDocumentStore
from haystack.nodes import DensePassageRetriever
doc_store = ChromaDocumentStore(persist_directory="chroma_store")
retriever = DensePassageRetriever(document_store=doc_store,
embedding_model="gemini-embedding")
Then for each query: get top-k passages and run the LLM in a QA chain. This aligns with Agno’s vector-tool
support. For structured data with semantic search, you can even combine SQL and vector queries: for
example, using FULL OUTER JOIN to merge results from a text search and a vector similarity search on
pgvector columns . This “hybrid query” approach yields both keyword matches and semantically related
rows in one query . The key is to fuse relational and similarity search – after retrieving relevant records,
feed them to Gemini for final answer generation.

Governance Layer (RBAC & Geo-Fencing)
Implement role-based and geographic access controls using JWT claims. Issue JWTs (signed with a secret or
RSA key) containing a role (e.g. “admin”, “user”) and a region or geo claim. In FastAPI, use a
dependency to decode and verify these tokens. For example:
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
import jwt
security = HTTPBearer()
def verify_jwt(token: str = Depends(security)):
payload = jwt.decode(token.credentials, SECRET, algorithms=["HS256"])
if payload.get("role") != "admin":
raise HTTPException(403, "Insufficient role")
if payload.get("region") not in {"us", "eu"}:
raise HTTPException(403, "Region not allowed")
return payload
Attach this to sensitive endpoints. Agno’s own reference code includes role-based decorators
( role_required , permission_required ) integrated with FastAPI . Also ensure endpoints check
the region claim (or use a trusted IP-to-geo lookup) so that requests outside allowed geographies are
blocked. Store user roles and region permissions in your database, or manage them via an IdP. Follow
established JWT auth patterns for FastAPI , and keep token lifetimes and signing keys secured (e.g. via
GCP Secret Manager).
Memory
The agent has both short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory is the conversation context (the
last few turns) and can be stored in the agent session (in-memory) or Redis for persistence across requests.
Agno supports plug-and-play memory drivers for session and persistent storage . For example, one
could use RedisMemory for fast caching of recent context, and a PostgresAgentStorage for longterm transcripts . Redis can also serve as a vector store (with RedisVector) for quick lookups or semantic
cache. Indeed, a Redis tutorial shows how to manage an agent’s memory: using a LangGraph
“checkpointer” for short-term memory and Redis (with vector lookup) for long-term memory . By
periodically summarizing or archiving older turns into Redis, the agent can recall past facts. Ensure memory
storage is secure and access-controlled (no sensitive PII without encryption).
Circuit Breakers, Health Checks, Retries
Circuit Breakers: Wrap external calls (e.g. LLM API, database) with circuit breakers to prevent cascading
failures. Libraries like fastapi-cb implement the classic Circuit Breaker pattern (from Release It! ).
For instance:
2
2
6
1
12
13
3
from fastapi_cb import CircuitBreaker
db_breaker = CircuitBreaker(fail_max=5, reset_timeout=60)
@db_breaker
async def query_db(q):
# query logic
This stops calling a failing subsystem until it recovers.
Health Checks: Expose a /health endpoint. It should attempt a lightweight check of dependencies (e.g.
ping the database, ensure Redis is reachable). Return HTTP 200 if all checks pass, or 503 if not. Example
(adapted from production guides):
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
db_ok = await check_db_connection()
cache_ok = await check_redis()
if db_ok and cache_ok:
return {"status": "healthy"}
return JSONResponse(status_code=503, content={"status": "unhealthy"})
Here, any failure triggers a non-200 status to signal orchestration systems .
Retries: Use retry/backoff for transient errors (network issues, rate limits). For HTTP/DB calls, libraries like
tenacity can retry on exceptions. Ensure idempotency or safe limits to avoid duplicating side effects.
Google’s FastAPI production checklist explicitly advises “retry mechanisms for external service calls” . For
example, on a timeout when calling the LLM API, pause and retry a few times before erroring. Combining
circuit breakers with retries gives robust fault tolerance.
Innovative Additions
Hybrid Query Intelligence: Combine semantic and keyword search in queries. For instance, after a
question, you might run both a similarity search (using pgvector or Chroma) and a SQL full-text
search, then merge results via UNION or FULL OUTER JOIN . This hybrid approach captures
both precise matches and related insights. You can even use the LLM to decide which search mode
fits best: e.g. “If the question is likely numeric or filter-based, use SQL; otherwise use vector search.”
Semantic Caching: Implement a cache layer that keys off semantic similarity rather than exact
match. Tools like GPTCache illustrate this: they “identify and store similar or related queries,
increasing cache hit probability” . Concretely, before calling the LLM on a query, check if a closeenough question was recently answered; if so, reuse that answer. This can massively reduce LLM
costs and latency. It can be built on Redis or a lightweight vector DB to store (query embedding →
response) pairs.
Auto-Index Suggestions: Use database analytics to optimize performance. PostgreSQL extensions
like pg_qualstats and hypopg can simulate indexes and recommend the best ones for slow
queries. For example, a Percona blog shows auto-suggested index statements (“CREATE INDEX ON
foo(bar)”) along with estimated speedup . You could automate this by logging slow SQL queries,
14

running hypopg , and storing recommendations (or even feeding this into an LLM to propose
indexes). Auto-indexing can dramatically speed up repeated text-to-SQL results.
PDF/Image Input Support: Allow the agent to ingest documents via OCR. Use tools like Docling or
MarkItDown to convert PDFs (even scanned ones) into text or markdown. For example, Docling can
load a PDF URL with enable_ocr=True and output markdown content ready for indexing . For
images (e.g. charts, receipts), use a Visual LLM or OCR model. The new Mistral OCR model can extract
text (including tables and formulas) from images/PDFs . Embed these pipelines so users can
upload documents; the backend converts and indexes their content into Chroma, then answers
questions over them.
Multimodal & Chains: (Bonus) Agno supports multimodal inputs. For images, you might
incorporate vision-to-text or use Gemini’s vision capabilities to interpret images directly. Consider
chaining tools (e.g. a Vision API followed by text QA) to handle diagrams or charts.
Deployment Roadmap (Local ➔ GCP)
Local Development: Set up a Python 3.9+ virtualenv, install FastAPI, Agno, database drivers, etc.
Run a local PostgreSQL (with pgvector extension) and Redis. Use Docker Compose for
convenience: one service for the FastAPI app, one for Postgres, one for Redis, and optionally one for
Chroma. In Docker, use a slim Python base, copy the app code and install dependencies. For
example, a Dockerfile might look like:
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
This matches best-practice templates . Use local environment variables or a .env file for secrets
(JWT key, API keys).
Testing: Write unit tests for core logic and integration tests for agent workflows. Test edge cases
(e.g. SQL errors, missing docs). Use pytest and CI (GitHub Actions) to run them on each push.
Containerization: Use Docker Build/Compose to bake containers. Push images to Google Container
Registry or Artifact Registry.
GCP Setup:
Cloud SQL (Postgres): Provision a Cloud SQL instance (Postgres) and enable the pgvector
extension. Follow [Cloud SQL docs] to enable public/private IP. The Agno agent-api example suggests
using Cloud SQL in production . Configure connection pooling (e.g. pgbouncer ).
Memorystore (Redis): Use Google Memorystore for Redis to cache embeddings, sessions, or as a
Celery broker.
Compute: Deploy the FastAPI container on Cloud Run or GKE. Cloud Run (fully managed) simplifies
scaling; ensure the service is in the same VPC or has authorized networks to reach Cloud SQL and
Memorystore. Use a Serverless VPC Access connector if needed.
Chroma: For the vector DB, options include: a managed service (Chroma Cloud), a Kubernetes
deployment, or running it alongside the app (in Cloud Run or Compute Engine). At minimum, ensure
persistent storage for Chroma’s database on GCP (e.g. a Persistent Disk on GCE or a Filestore).

Networking & Secrets: Use Cloud IAM to restrict service accounts. Store secrets (Gemini API key,
JWT secret) in Secret Manager and mount them or fetch at runtime. Use IAM roles so Cloud Run can
access SQL/Redis securely.
CI/CD: Set up Cloud Build or GitHub Actions to trigger on commits. Automated build and push of
container, and automatic deployment to Cloud Run (or GKE) on merges to main.
DNS & SSL: If using Cloud Run, map a custom domain and provision HTTPS via Google-managed
certificates or Cloud Load Balancing with IAP for additional auth.
Best Practices and Security Considerations
Authentication & Authorization: Rely on proven JWT libraries (e.g. PyJWT or FastAPI’s OAuth2 tools)
to verify tokens. Validate every request’s token and enforce roles/permissions (use dependencies like
Depends(verify_jwt) ). Store roles/permissions in the database and avoid hardcoding.
Input Validation: Use Pydantic models for request bodies to enforce correct schema. Escape or
parameterize all SQL. As noted in security guides, always compose SQL using parameters/ORMs to
“prevent Python SQL injection” . Never format user text directly into queries.
Secrets Management: Do not hardcode credentials. Use environment variables or cloud secret
services (e.g. GCP Secret Manager). Disable root/postgres superuser access. Use least-privilege DB
users (e.g. read-only where applicable).
Encryption: Enable TLS for all in-flight data. For PostgreSQL, use SSL connections. Host FastAPI
behind HTTPS (Cloud Run provides this by default). Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g. use CMEK for
Cloud SQL if needed). Use JWT with strong signing keys (rotate keys regularly).
Rate Limiting & Monitoring: Throttle excessive requests to avoid abuse (e.g. use a FastAPI
middleware or Cloud Armor). Monitor usage of the LLM to control costs. Tools like AgentOps can log
every agent action, aiding debugging and audit trails . Set up logging and metrics: FastAPI’s
logging plus a tool like Prometheus/GCP Monitoring. Track key metrics (request count, latencies,
error rates) and set alerts .
Error Handling: Return generic error messages to clients. Log exceptions server-side with context.
Do not leak stack traces or sensitive data in API responses.
Dependency Updates: Regularly update Python and library versions. Scan dependencies for
vulnerabilities. For example, include GitHub Dependabot or Snyk checks.
Schema Migrations: Use Alembic or similar for Postgres schema changes; never alter schema inflight. Automate backups of the database (Cloud SQL automated backups) and periodically test
restores.
Testing & Auditing: Implement unit/integration tests for each component. Include security tests
(e.g. ensure forbidden roles are blocked). Keep an audit log of agent queries and data access (use an
immutable log or cloud logging). This is crucial for compliance.
By following this structured guide and leveraging open-source tools (FastAPI, Agno, Chroma, Redis,
pgvector, etc.), you can build a small-scale but robust agent backend. This system will understand natural
language, query both structured and unstructured data intelligently, and enforce governance policies – all
ready to deploy from local dev to Google Cloud production.
